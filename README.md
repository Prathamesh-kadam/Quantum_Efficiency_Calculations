# Quantum_Efficiency_Calculations
This repository contains Python code for calculating quantum efficiency parameters (η_cu, η_STH, and η_T^Q) based on photon energy distribution data. The calculations are derived from integration methods applied to spectral data, following equations from research on photocatalytic and energy conversion efficiency.
